# The Move Language

Move is a safe and reliable language developed for blockchains by [Diem](https://diem.com/) (ex-Libra). You can read language white paper on [diem developers website](https://developers.diem.com/papers/diem-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2020-05-26.pdf). And you can find perfect answer to why it's suited for blockchain use [here](https://community.diem.com/c/move/8).

This book is a collection of all the information which my colleagues and I found and shaped into a single source of knowledge about Move language.
